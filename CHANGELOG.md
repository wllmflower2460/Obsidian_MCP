# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.7] - 2025-06-20

### Changed

- **Package Update**: Fixed README & incremented version to 2.0.7 to ensure the latest changes are reflected in the npm package.

## [2.0.6] - 2025-06-20

### Changed

- **Tool Renaming**: Renamed `obsidian_read_file`, `obsidian_delete_file`, and `obsidian_list_files` to `obsidian_read_note`, `obsidian_delete_note`, and `obsidian_list_notes` respectively. This change improves semantic clarity and aligns the tool names more closely with Obsidian's terminology, reducing ambiguity for AI agents.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated all dependencies to their latest versions.
- **Documentation Improvements**: Updated `.clinerules` to reflect the new tool names and ensure all documentation is current.

## [2.0.5] - 2025-06-20

### Changed

- **Tool Renaming**: Renamed the `obsidian_update_file` tool to `obsidian_update_note` to avoid conflicts and better reflect its function. During agentic use, LLMs confused this tool with filesystem operations, leading to errors. The new name clarifies that it operates on Obsidian notes specifically.
- **HTTP Transport Refactor**: Restructured the HTTP transport layer for improved clarity and robustness. Authentication logic is now more modular, and a centralized error handler has been implemented.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated all dependencies to their latest versions.
- **Documentation Improvements**: Enhanced the documentation around installation & MCP Client configuration. Suggested by [@bgheneti](https://github.com/bgheneti) in [PR #14](https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server/pull/14). Thanks!

## [2.0.4] - 2025-06-13

### Added

- **Recursive File Listing**: The `obsidian_list_files` tool now supports recursive listing of directories with a `recursionDepth` parameter.

### Changed

- **Documentation**:
  - Consolidated tool specifications into `obsidian_mcp_tools_spec.md`.
  - Updated `.clinerules` with a detailed logger implementation example for the agent.
  - Updated the repository's directory tree documentation.

## [2.0.3] - 2025-06-12

### Fixed

- **NPM Package Display**: Explicitly included `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `CHANGELOG.md` in the `files` array in `package.json` to ensure they are displayed correctly on the npm package page.

## [2.0.2] - 2025-06-12

### Fixed

- **NPM Package Version**: Bad npm package. Bumping to v2.0.2 for publishing.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-06-12

### Added

- **Enhanced Documentation**:
  - Added a warning to the `VaultCacheService` documentation about its potential for high memory usage on large vaults.
  - Added a code comment in `obsidianManageFrontmatterTool` to clarify the regex-based key deletion strategy.

### Changed

- **Improved SSL Handling**: The `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL` environment variable is now correctly parsed as a boolean, ensuring more reliable SSL verification behavior.
- **API Service Refactoring**: Simplified the `httpsAgent` handling within the `ObsidianRestApiService` to improve code clarity and remove redundant agent creation on each request.

### Fixed

- **Path Import Correction**: Corrected a path import in the `obsidianGlobalSearchTool` to use `node:path/posix` for better cross-platform compatibility.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-06-12

Version 2.0.0 is a complete overhaul of the Obsidian MCP Server, migrating it to my [`cyanheads/mcp-ts-template`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template). This release introduces a more robust architecture, a streamlined toolset, enhanced security, and significant performance improvements. It is a breaking change from the 1.x series.

### Added

- **New Core Architecture**: The server is now built on the [`cyanheads/mcp-ts-template`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template), providing a standardized, modular, and maintainable structure.
- **Hono HTTP Transport**: The HTTP transport has been migrated from Express to Hono, offering a more lightweight and performant server.
- **Vault Cache Service**: A new in-memory `VaultCacheService` has been introduced. It caches vault content to improve performance for search operations and provides a resilient fallback if the Obsidian API is temporarily unavailable. It also refreshes periodically.
- **Advanced Authentication**:
  - Added support for **OAuth 2.1** bearer token validation alongside the existing secret key-based JWTs.
  - Introduced `authContext` using `AsyncLocalStorage` for secure, request-scoped access to authentication details.
- **New Tools**:
  - `obsidian_delete_file`: A new tool to permanently delete files from the vault.
  - `obsidian_search_replace`: A powerful new tool to perform search and replace operations with regex support.
- **Enhanced Utilities**:
  - **Request Context**: A robust request context system (`requestContextService`) for improved logging and tracing.
  - **Error Handling**: A centralized `ErrorHandler` for consistent and detailed error reporting.
  - **Async Utilities**: A `retryWithDelay` utility is now used across the application to make API calls more resilient.
- **New Development Scripts**: Added `docs:generate` (for TypeDoc) and `inspect:stdio`/`inspect:http` (for MCP Inspector) to `package.json`.

### Changed

- **Project Structure**: The entire project has been reorganized to align with the [`cyanheads/mcp-ts-template`](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template), improving separation of concerns (e.g., `services`, `mcp-server`, `types-global`).
- **Tool Consolidation and Enhancement**: The toolset has been redesigned for clarity and power:
  - `obsidian_list_files` replaces `obsidian_list_files_in_vault` and `obsidian_list_files_in_dir`, offering more flexible filtering.
  - `obsidian_read_file` replaces `obsidian_get_file_contents` and now supports returning content as structured JSON.
  - `obsidian_update_file` replaces `obsidian_append_content` and `obsidian_update_content` with explicit modes (`append`, `prepend`, `overwrite`).
  - `obsidian_global_search` replaces `obsidian_find_in_file` with added support for path/date filtering and pagination.
  - `obsidian_manage_frontmatter` replaces `obsidian_get_properties` and `obsidian_update_properties` with atomic get/set/delete operations.
  - `obsidian_manage_tags` replaces `obsidian_get_tags` and now manages both frontmatter and inline tags.
- **Configuration Overhaul**: Environment variables have been renamed for consistency and clarity.
  - `OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL` now consolidates protocol, host, and port.
  - New variables like `MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE`, `MCP_LOG_LEVEL`, and `MCP_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` have been introduced.
- **Dependency Updates**: All dependencies, including the MCP SDK, have been updated to their latest stable versions.
- **Obsidian API Service**: The `ObsidianRestApiService` has been completely refactored into a modular class, providing a typed, resilient, and centralized client for all interactions with the Obsidian Local REST API.

### Removed

- **Removed Tools**: The following tools from version 1.x have been removed and their functionality integrated into the new, more comprehensive tools:
  - `obsidian_list_files_in_vault`
  - `obsidian_list_files_in_dir`
  - `obsidian_get_file_contents`
  - `obsidian_append_content`
  - `obsidian_update_content`
  - `obsidian_find_in_file`
  - `obsidian_complex_search` (path-based searching is now a filter in `obsidian_global_search`)
  - `obsidian_get_tags`
  - `obsidian_get_properties`
  - `obsidian_update_properties`
- **Removed Resources**: The `obsidian://tags` resource has been removed. Tag information is now available through the `obsidian_manage_tags` tool. I may add the resource back in the future if there is demand for it. Please open an issue if you would like to see it return.
- **Old Configuration**: All old, non-prefixed environment variables (e.g., `VERIFY_SSL`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`) have been removed in favor of the new, standardized configuration schema.
